# Protein Sequence Analysis of Hemoglobin Alpha Subunit

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **alpha subunit of hemoglobin**, a critical oxygen-transport protein in red blood cells. The goal is to identify and annotate functional domains, motifs, and structural features using bioinformatics tools.

## Objectives

- Annotate protein domains and motifs using **InterProScan**.
- Interpret associated **Gene Ontology (GO)** terms for biological function.
- Identify secondary structural elements using **PSIPRED** with **DSSP** notation.
- Relate structure to function through combined annotation.

## Data Sources and tools

- **Protein Sequence**: Retrieved from UniProt (e.g., [P69905](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P69905)).
- **PSIPRED**: Used for assigning secondary structures (e.g., helix, loop).
- **InterProScan**: Used for predicting motifs and domains.
- **GO terms & Reactome**: Provided in InterProScan output.

## Workflow

1. Retrieve the hemoglobin alpha sequence.
2. Assign secondary sturcutre using PSIPRED
3. Run InterProScan and collect `.tsv` results.
4. Parse and filter annotations based on significance (e.g., E-values).
5. Add GO term and Reactome pathway interpretations.
6. Combine sequence and structure features in one annotation table.

## ðŸ“Š Results

composotion of the protein in terms of the amino acid shows that protein subunit has higer level of Alanine amino acid.

The following alignment shows the relative positions of the aamino acid and the secondary of which the amino acid is a part of. The Protein majorly comprises of alpha helices.

### The table shows the domans and motifs in the protien subunit. Amino acid from position 4-29 act as the iron ion binding and comprise of only alpha helices.

## ðŸ§  Biological Interpretation

- Hemoglobin alpha subunit is essential for **oxygen binding and transport**.
- Identified motifs **globin domain**, **heme-binding site** which support the protien.

## ðŸ’­ Limitations and Future Work

- Some annotations may overlap or be redundant.
- Structural annotations depend on quality of the input PDB file.
- Future steps could include:
  - Comparative analysis with beta subunit.
  - Multiple sequence alignment across species.
